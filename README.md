Visualizations were plotted from 2013 to 2017 Dst Index data. <br>
Each year was plotted representing January to December values. <br>
Every chart displays the day-month-year with its minimum, maximum and average Dst index values of that day. <br>
Each bar represents the range of values for that particular day. <br>
